                      How to get started with Linux
                    </h1>
                    <br>
                      <p>Hello in this tutorial I prepared some paragraph to help you with using commands for Linux</p>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <h1>basic commands to start having fun with linux:
so you started exploring linux? thats awesome, now lets learn some basic commands so you dont end up going back to windows ðŸ˜… so lets start</h1><br>

<p>cd: imagine you are in Desktop, and you opend your terminal there, and there is two folder available there, named folder1 and folder2, now type "cd folder1" to go there in your terminal, and for going back, you can write "cd .." tada ðŸŽ‰ you are back to desktop</p><br>

<p>pwd: so lets say, you opened your terminal and wrote and wrote and wrote, and after doing some stuff, you forget where are you? now write "pwd" to see you which directory you are exploring :)</p><br>
<p>ls: so you want to see the files available in directory you are in? just type "ls" or if you want to see hidden files too, just type "ls -a"</p><br>
<p>mkdir & rmdir: if you want to make a folder, just type "mkdir (foldername)", now if you type ls, you will find the folder you created there, now if you want to delete it, just simple type "rmdir (foldername)" but keep in mind, if you want to remove a director with rmdir, it should be empty, but if the folder you trying to delete includes files, you can simply type "rm -r (foldername)", or if you want to delete a file, you can type "rm (filename)" or even lets there is a file in folder1, and it called test, so you need to write "rm folder1/test" to remove it without moving to folder1</p><br>
<p>touch: so if you want to make a file, no matter what, .txt, .zip, .py and etc, you can write "touch (filename)" in my case i want to make an empty html file so i write "touch filename.html"</p><br>
<p>--help: now lets say you have a program, and dont know how to use it, just type "(programname) --help" for example i want to see how to use python, so i write "python --help"</p><br>
<p>cp & cp -r: so if you want to copy a file to another folder, u need to type "cp (filename) (foldername)" lets say you are in home directory and ls shows you folder1 and folder2, and there is a file called test in folder1 which you want to copy it to folder2, so just write, "cp folder1/test folder2" and boom now it copied in folder2, but let say you want to copy the folder1 to folder2, you need to write "cp -r folder1 folder2" and now of you cd to folder2 and get an ls, you will see folder1 there, and if you cd to folder1 and take an ls there too, u will see file called test</p><br>
<p>mv: so if you want to move a file or folder to another folder, type "mv (filename) (foldername)" or "mv (foldername) (foldername)" i want to move test1 directory to test2 directory, so i type "mv test1 test2"</p><br>
<p>echo: now let's think you have a test.txt, and you want to write something in it, but you don't want to open your text editor, just type "echo (what you want to write) >> test.txt"
