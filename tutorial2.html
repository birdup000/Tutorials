                  <br>
                  Let's start with Domain Name Servers (DNS)
                  First of all, what is a domain name server? 
                  Basically what a domain name server is like a phonebook for ip addresses and they contain domains which correlate to the ip addresses 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Using a fast domain name server can be beneficial for loading times for websites and more
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  You may ask how do I find a fast DNS server?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  You could test each dns server one by one , you don’t have to do that but you could it would be time consuming and possibly stressful.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Luckily Gibson Research Corporation created a tool called DNS benchmark to reduce stress and time it rather then to manually test each server one by one 
                  <br>
                   can download the dns benchmark here:<u><a style="color:rgb(76, 76, 226); "  href="https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm">https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm</a></u>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Here’s how you use the program 
                  When opened you’ll see tabs please select nameservers
                  It will say something like “Please wait a few moments while the list of DNS resolvers is loaded and characterized” 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Wait for it to load then what we want to do is after completing loading is to select run benchmark it should start testing for the fastest dns server if not it will just test the dns servers you’ll want to make suresort fastest first if checked already. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  After the benchmark you’ll have the list of fastest servers at the top of the list copy the ip address and you’ll want to follow these steps accordingly for your operating system.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Windows
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Open file explorer and right click on network and then select properties this will give you your active connections select ethernet if your on ethernet network or wifi adapter if you’re using a wifi connection this will open up window called wifi status or network status <br>
                   in this window you’ll want to select properties and then it will pop open another window double click on in the list called Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) this will also open up a window in here you’ll be able to select ‘Use the following DNS server addresses’
                  <br> 
                  and then you’ll see Preferred DNS server and Alternate DNS server. Depending on what server came the fastest, check what provider it is from such as Cloudflare(1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1),Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4),and many more depending on what’s fastest in your location.
                  <br>
                   I would choose the first provider and stick with the first fastest provider from the DNS server and use the secondary(alternate) same for the primary(preferred).
                  <br>
                   Enter your fastest dns server in the Preferred dns server section and if you have a provider that has a secondary enter the secondary in the alternate dns server section 
                  <br>  
                  <br>
                  After you enter the ipv4 dns servers you can also enter the dns server provider for the ipv6 connection this is optional it is basically the same process just enter the ipv6 address from the fastest provider from the same provider for the ipv4.</pre>
